#Empty TypeScript Project

A starter TypeScript project with just enough to get started.  Clone this repository and then run the following commands to get started:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```
Lite-Server will automatically launch a browser window and refresh as files change.

[Watch the YouTube Video](https://youtu.be/Wg4EEdKPK1M) to see how to get started.  In the video, I am using Visual Studio Code as an editor
